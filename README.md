- 👋 Hi, My online handle is @AdamDotJ, but you can just call me Adam. Also the Reddit & Twitter Handles for @AdamDotJ are **NOT** me. They were scooped up by someone else 😢.
- 👀 I’m interested mostly in gaming and programming or anything analytical for that matter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use and interact with GitHub. I know I'm late to the party 😄.
- 💞️ I’m not sure what I'm looking to collaborate on at the moment, maybe ClassicPress or something AI related. I have been playing with the Large Language Models recently.
- 📫 You can reach me at **adamdotj@gmail.com** assuming it doesn't wind up in my spam folder. No Promises.
